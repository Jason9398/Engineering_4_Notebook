## Launch Pad 1
### Assignment Description
This is the first assignment in a series where I build a simulated launch pad. In this section, I wrote a script to count down from 10 second to liftoff.

## Reflection
At first I had a hard time remembering the differences between the types of loops. A while loop runs until the condition is not longer satisfied, while a for loop runs for loop runs a specific number of times. A for loop was appropriate in this case, as I am always counting down from 10. I also had to look up the syntax for using the range function in a for loop. After some googling, I re-learned that the order is as follows: range(starting number, ending number, increment amount.

## Reflection

In this assignment we Had to write a code in which it would count dowen and for each secand a green led would flash green and at the end a red led would flash then print liftoff.this assignment gave me good inroduction into using V.S code.this assingment was very hard for me because I had neer done somthing like this before but once I got the hang of it it was essey.Now I how to make it count down and what time. sleep is.

## Reflection
In this assigment we Had to write a code where when we hit a butten it would start a countdowen from 10 to 0 and for each secand the light would blink green and at zero a red led would flash and then print lifftoff.The hardest about this was figuring out what to put on my code and trying to get the butten to get butten to go into the bord in this assigment I lernt more about coding.

## Refection
In this assighment we had to write a code where we have a countdown from 10 to 0 and for each secand a green led will blink green and at the end a red led will flash and then print liftoff.After print liftoff the servo will spin.The hardest pat of this assighments was adding in the new code and getting confused with the example code and the real code.

## Reflection
In this assighnment we needed to write a code that would primt acelleration for X,Y,Z or anguler valocity the wiring for this assignment was pretty easy The hardent part about the wirinh was I did not have the pin map when I did it.Another hard part about this assighment is that I needed to add new files for this assighment and write a whole new code.

## Raspberry_Pi_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here. You need to communicate what your thing does. 

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch. 

### Code
Give me a link to your code. [Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py). Don't make me hunt through your folders, give me a nice link to click to take me there! Remember to **COMMENT YOUR CODE** if you want full credit. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection
