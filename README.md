## Launch Pad 1
### Assignment Description
This is the first assignment in a series where I build a simulated launch pad. In this section, I wrote a script to count down from 10 second to liftoff.

## Reflection
At first I had a hard time remembering the differences between the types of loops. A while loop runs until the condition is not longer satisfied, while a for loop runs for loop runs a specific number of times. A for loop was appropriate in this case, as I am always counting down from 10. I also had to look up the syntax for using the range function in a for loop. After some googling, I re-learned that the order is as follows: range(starting number, ending number, increment amount.

## Reflection

In this assignment we Had to write a code in which it would count dowen and for each secand a green led would flash green and at the end a red led would flash then print liftoff.this assignment gave me good inroduction into using V.S code.this assingment was very hard for me because I had neer done somthing like this before but once I got the hang of it it was essey.Now I how to make it count down and what time. sleep is.

## Reflection
In this assigment we Had to write a code where when we hit a butten it would start a countdowen from 10 to 0 and for each secand the light would blink green and at zero a red led would flash and then print lifftoff.The hardest about this was figuring out what to put on my code and trying to get the butten to get butten to go into the bord in this assigment I lernt more about coding.

## Refection
In this assighment we had to write a code where we have a countdown from 10 to 0 and for each secand a green led will blink green and at the end a red led will flash and then print liftoff.After print liftoff the servo will spin.The hardest pat of this assighments was adding in the new code and getting confused with the example code and the real code.

## Reflection
In this assighnment we needed to write a code that would primt acelleration for X,Y,Z or anguler valocity the wiring for this assignment was pretty easy The hardent part about the wirinh was I did not have the pin map when I did it.Another hard part about this assighment is that I needed to add new files for this assighment and write a whole new code.

## Reflection
This in assignment we had to write a cod where when you tillted the bread in the directions left,right,fowerd,and back at a 90 degree angle a green led would flash  in each direction.The hardest part about this assighment was hat I forgot how to wire an led it took me a second to remenber how. and like in part one of this assighment I aslso had to print angler volocety.

## Reflection
In this assighment we had to Have angler volocity print on  oled screen.The hardest part about this assighment was part was making sure my whiring was perfect anf getting he cordinets that I needed.Anather thing was that all the wires on my bread borded got realy confusing and when one came out I was confuesed on where they went but also in this I asighment I learned more about coding.

## Reflection
In this assighment I had to write a code to caluclate the area of a tringle using its courdinates The annoying part about this assighment as because my cose was wrong it kept maling me renter the points over and over agein.One thing I did learn was  a new way on V.S code to get the computer to show  me what I had wrong on my code. 
## Raspberry_Pi_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here. You need to communicate what your thing does. 

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch. 

### Code
Give me a link to your code. [Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py). Don't make me hunt through your folders, give me a nice link to click to take me there! Remember to **COMMENT YOUR CODE** if you want full credit. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## OnshapeBeam

### Assignment Description

Beam designed in onshape with specific hole parameters and a max weight of 13g in PLA. Made to hold up a # of weight from a hanging object at the very end.

### Part Image

![Photo](images/Beam.png)

### Reflection

Began this project doing some reasearch on beam theory and strongest beam designs. The "T" or "I" beam are the strongest versions of a simplified beam. I could not have overhang like how an "I" beam is designed, so I created a T beam. Used the most weight in the middle beam as the vertical strength is more important than the horizontal. Also filleted egdes on the vertical to prevent corners and stresss concentrators. 

## SimScale

### Assignment Description

Beam designed in onshape is tested in SimScale. Used 4 total simulations and the 2nd one I did was the best.

### Part Image

![Photo](images/SimscaleBeam.png)

### Reflection

Ran my first simulation and it had a very clear breaking point at the end of the beam. Redesigned multiple times making the bottom beam thicker each time. At the end I realized the 2nd simulation held up the most force, so I decided with that one.

## OnshapeBeamRe-design

### Assignment Description

Re-design of the beam after using simscale.

### Part Image

![Photo](images/FinalBeam.png)

### Reflection

I tried doing various things such as changing the bottom beam height, open holes, and middle beam width. I changed the bottom beam height because otherwise the end piece with the hole supporting weight would snap too easy. I made a hole in the middle beam to lessen the mass. I also thinned the middle beam width also to lessen the mass. After a couple redesigns making the bottom beam thicker and everything else thinner, I realized meeting in the middle worked the best. Started off with 129.6 mPa on the stress level and got it down to 40.84 on the most stressed section.
